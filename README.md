# MultiplesOf

This is a simple app which:
* adds multiples of 7 up to 100
* adds multiples of 8 from 100 up to 200
* adds multiples of 9 from 200 up to 300

This is achieved using two nested while loops. The first loop iterates which multiple and what the ceiling is, while the second does the actual multiplication and prints the count to the command line.

There is also a multiplication function. This does basically nothing other than take the current count and add the current multiple to it. It is only there so that I could add a Jest unit test to the whole thing.
